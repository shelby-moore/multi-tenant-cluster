# Experimental Installation of NetChecks

See [https://github.com/hardbyte/netchecks/blob/main/operator/README.md#installation](https://github.com/hardbyte/netchecks/blob/main/operator/README.md#installation).

I took the CRDs in [https://github.com/hardbyte/netchecks/tree/main/operator/charts/netchecks/crds](https://github.com/hardbyte/netchecks/tree/main/operator/charts/netchecks/crds) and put them in [./base](base).

I took the static manifests in [https://github.com/hardbyte/netchecks/blob/main/operator/README.md#static-manifests](https://github.com/hardbyte/netchecks/blob/main/operator/README.md#static-manifests) and put them in [./base](base). Once the Helm chart is publicly available, switch to it.
